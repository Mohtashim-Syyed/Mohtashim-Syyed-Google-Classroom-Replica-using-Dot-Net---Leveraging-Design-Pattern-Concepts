# Mohtashim-Syyed-Google-Classroom-Replica-using-Dot-Net---Leveraging-Design-Pattern-Concepts

This project is a Google Classroom Replica developed in .Net, designed to demonstrate effective use of software design patterns and clean architectural principles. It replicates the core functionalities of Google Classroom—such as classroom creation, user roles, assignment management, submissions, and announcements—while maintaining a highly modular, scalable, and maintainable code structure.

By leveraging key design patterns (such as Factory, Observer, Strategy, and Repository), the system ensures clear separation of concerns, reusability of components, and flexibility for future enhancements. The project showcases best practices in object-oriented programming (OOP), emphasizing abstraction, encapsulation, and interface-driven development.

This replica serves as both an educational tool and a demonstration of how real-world systems can be architected using modern design principles in C#, making it ideal for learning, portfolio presentation, or further expansion into a complete learning management platform.
